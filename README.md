# Hydra.Php
 Cut off one head and two grow back

Hydra.Php is a single purpose library (or a lightweigth framework, if you prefer).

Its only purpose is build faster and reliable APIs easier, applying best API project pratices

There are few static settings working for this project, and we strongly recommend to not 
change them:

1. REST
2. JSON
3. JWT TOKEN SECURITY BASED

If you need anything but those settings, it's better to you don't use this library (it's better
to you don't use PHP indeed)
