# Hydra.Php
 Cut off one head and two grow back

Hydra.Php is a single purpose library (or a lightweight framework, if you prefer).

Its only purpose is build faster and reliable APIs, applying best API project pratices

There are few static settings working for this project, and we strongly recommend to not 
change them:

1. REST
2. JSON
3. JWT TOKEN SECURITY BASED
4. APACHE

If you need anything but those settings, it's better to you don't use this library (it's better
to you don't use PHP indeed)


Otherwise, if you really need a CRUD based API, with few rules, requiring a cheap infraestruture, so you are in the right place. This tool was made for this specific scenario:
Low budget, high performance required

And you can rely on PHP stability as language, thousands of excellent php programmers around world and an easy (almost self explained) framework structure. 

You can build a machine in docker, put this code in root folder and in few steps provide 
data for any client around world!

Wellcome to Hydra!
